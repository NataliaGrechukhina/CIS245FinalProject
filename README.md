# CIS245FinalProject
Flower design company

This website was created by Natalia Grechukhina to show what knowledge of CIS 245 Web Development II class was gained during this Winter Quarter 2021.

The website consists of two HTML files (2 pages allowed by instructor) and two CSS files (required by instructor) located at www folder. 

The files are named: 
- index.html
- aboutus.html
- mobile.css
- styles.css

The site was created for a flower company that designs and decorates events with flowers. This company does not exist and was invented by me only for my Final Project.

The index.html page is used to facilitate navigation to other pages of the site by providing links to other pages on the site. The index.html page also contains information about the author of the website in the bottom of the page, the page is free of content and serves as a Welcome page for the visitor and asking to contact with company.

The aboutus.html page displays information about the company and on this page you can see photos of the company's team in the side area of the website.

In this project I have two CSS files, first one for regular stylesheet settings of website and other one for mobile version of website.
